For this quiz homework, I used some Bootstrap and JQuery code to create the quiz buttons, while the boxes were using CSS.  The questions were taken from the demonstration gif.  

The script.js file contains the functions used to present the questions, have the user select the answers, inform the user if their selection was correct or not, calculate and display the remaining time and user scores, and store and recall the user scores and initials.
